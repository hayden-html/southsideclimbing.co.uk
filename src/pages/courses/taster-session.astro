            Our taster session will give you an introduction to the sport. We
            run these sessions in small groups, so you'll have plenty of time to
            climb. Unlike our courses, we don't teach belaying or knot tying in
            this session.

        <Qa question="Who can climb?">
            With roped climbing, climbers need to be aged 9+ and can fit a
            helmet and harness. Equipment sizes can be found on the <a
                href="/resources/policies/booking-terms.pdf">booking terms</a
            >. Please <a href="/contact/">send us a message</a> if you're unsure
            you can climb.
        </Qa>
        <Qa question="Where will I meet my Instructor?">
            We will send you an exact location once we receive a good forecast.
            We’ll get in touch a couple of days before your course.
        </Qa>
        <Qa question="May I bring spectators?">
            On our private courses spectators are welcome to join. Please let us
            know if your planning on bringing a spectator.
        </Qa>

            Yes, all legal parents and guardians of under-18's need to be
            present during the session. If you are booking for other children to
            join, their parent or guardian must be present throughout the
            course.
        </Qa>
        <Qa question="What if it rains?">
            We won't run sessions if the weather is too poor to climb. The
            Refund Policy is on our <a
